/*
 You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
 
 0 representing an empty cell,
 1 representing a fresh orange, or
 2 representing a rotten orange.
 Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
 
 Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
