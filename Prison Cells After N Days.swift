 There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

 Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

 If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
 Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
 (Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

 We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.

 Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)
